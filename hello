Subject: Brief Introduction – Sameer Alam

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am Sameer Alam, a recent B.Tech graduate in Computer Science and Engineering, and I have recently joined Standard Chartered GBS as a Technology Apprentice.

I recently completed an intensive Java Full Stack Development training, where I gained hands-on experience in Java, Spring Boot, React, and SQL, covering both frontend and backend development. During the program, I collaborated on a Loan Origination System, a banking application project that enhanced my skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and end-to-end development.

I am excited to be part of the team and look forward to learning, contributing, and adding value to upcoming projects.

Please find my photo attached below.

Best regards,
Sameer Alam
